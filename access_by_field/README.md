This module provides additional access restrictions based on the value of a common field between user and entity. If both the fields hold same value, the user will have access to operations its role has opted. View, Edit and Delete operations can be managed for Entities (Content and Taxonomy).

Allowed field types:
1. Entity Reference that includes Term & Content.
2. Boolean
3. Select

About module configuration:
1. The module provides two forms; for adding field mappings & managing role access.
2. We have a dashboard as well, where user can get list of all mappings done.

How to add field mapping:
1. Navigate to Configuration -> Content Authoring -> Access by field.
2. Click on Go to Fields Mapping action.
3. It opens up a form that allows you to add mapping label & choose entities from options: Content, Audio & Vocabulary.
4. Based on the first selection, you get to see list of bundles.
5. The complete form loads depending on bundle selected in second step.
5. To update an existing configuration, go to mapping dashboard and edit mapping.
